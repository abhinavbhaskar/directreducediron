    "1. This paper presents the development of a mathematical model to describe the direct reduction of iron oxides in a shaft furnace. The concept of the shrinking core model was adopted. A pellet model was developed for the direct reduced iron using three consecutive reaction schemes, while the furnace was modelled as a one-dimensional steady state moving bed reactor. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/1743281211Y.0000000023?src=recsys\n",

    "Most of the shaft furnaces use hydrogen rich gas as reducing gas. The materials and heat balances show that the heat balance determines the gas consumption. Compared with the gas requirement by chemical reaction, a much greater quantity of gas has to be blown into the furnace to satisfy the heat balance,leading to a high energy consumption and high excess of reduction potential of top gas, which is defined as (COzH2)/(H2OCO2). Since published references about solving such problems are rather limited, a new method is proposed in this paper for modifying the shaft furnace with oxygen blowing. In this new process, oxygen is blown into the upper zone of the shaft furnace for the combustion of some gas so to increase the temperature in the upper part of the furnace. As a result, the kinetic condition for reduction reaction is perfectly satisfied, and the reduction rate is increased. Therefore, the utilisation of gas is enhanced, and energy consumption is reduced essentially.A similar system can be deployed even in a 100% hydrogen based system to increase the kinetics of the reaction . https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/1743281213Y.0000000168?src=recsys\n",
    "3. Important paper on mathematical modelling of iron ore reduction with pure hydrogen. The paper contains information about the experimental set-up, which a double crucible TGA set-up from Setaram : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652612003836\n",
    "4. In the standard processes using reducing gas (syn gas) in the final step ( 3 hours) is cooling and carburizing step, during which carbon from carbon monoxide is deposited simultaneously with cooling. In the case of pure hydrogen the step is different and this we call it cooling and extra reduction step in which hydrogen raises the degree of metallization instead of carbon deposition which inhibits extra reduction due to the sealing of the porosity of the product sponge. Link to paper abstract : https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jaots.2010.13.issue-1/jaots-2010-0116/jaots-2010-0116.xml\n",
    "As expected, the first two reactions are very fast compared with the wustite-iron transformation. It should be pointed out that complete conversion to metallic iron is attained 2m above the bottom of the furnace (solid outlet). Thus, in these conditions, a 4-m high reactor would suffice to achieve the reduction. This is an important result because, in a conventional MIDREX process, a 9-m high reduction zone is needed to attain 92% of conversion at the solid outlet, using syngas as reducing agent in the same conditions. Reference : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1715.pdf\n",
    "5. The first results from the model showed that complete conversion to metallic iron using pure H2 could be obtained using a more compact reactor than current industrial DR furnaces, which use syngas (CO+H2) as a reducing agent. This confirms the fact that reduction by H2 is faster than that by CO. A parametric study showed that the size of the pellets and the temperature of the inlet gas have strong influence on the reduction rate: the smaller the pellet diameter, the faster the reduction and thus the more compact the reactor. The optimum temperature was found to be 800oC. At higher temperatures, the densification of iron due to sintering causes the reaction to slow down at high conversions. The next steps of this work should be to verify if the kinetics used are valid for entire pellets and to adapt the model for the reduction of iron ore by H2/CO mixtures to validate the model against operation data of existing industrial DR process.Reference : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1715.pdf\n",
    "Not so important but just go through the paper : https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11663-014-0136-6\n",
    "6. The present work also emphasized the importance of evaluation of the reduction mechanisms and the properties of different types of iron ore pellets prior to developing a process model. While the present approach has established a good foundation for the dynamic modeling of the shaft reactor, more efforts are required to accomplish a realistic process model. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11663-016-0895-3\n",
    "7. In this study, the kinetic mechanism of reduction of hematite particles was studied in a hydrogen atmosphere. The phases and morphological transformation of hematite during the reduction were characterized using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. It was found that porous magnetite was formed, and the particles were degraded during the reduction. Finally, sintering of the reduced iron and wüstite retarded the reductive progress. The average activation energy was extracted to be 86.1 kJ/mol and 79.1 kJ/mol according to Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Starink methods, respectively. The reaction fraction dependent values of activation energy were suggested to be the result of multi-stage reactions during the reduction process. Furthermore, the variation of activation energy value was smoothed after heat treatment of hematite particles.https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/10/751\n",
    "https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/11/7/1094\n",
    "8. The kinetics of reduction of iron ore powder by H2 and CO gas mixtures with different compositions were studied using a commercial TGA setup. The results showed that the apparent rates of reaction vary linearly with the H2 and CO contents of the gas. Larger amount of H2 resulted in higher reaction rates. The data were employed in the developed reduction model for pellets. The model was based on the mechanism observed in the commercial iron ore pellets reduced by pure hydrogen. The microstructure of reacted pellets showed that reduction of the examined industrial samples is controlled by both chemical reaction and gaseous diffusion. The reduction model was developed by combining computations for the flow and mass transfer in the gas phase, diffusion of gases in the solid phase and chemical reaction at the reaction sites. The modelling and experimental results were in reasonably good agreement. The present model provides a good foundation for a dynamic multi-particle process model. The results highlighted the importance of considering the reduction mechanisms in different types of pellets prior to modelling.http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A954514&dswid=7597\n",
    "9. The local mass, energy, and momentum balances are numerically solved, using the finite volume method. This model was successfully validated by simulating the shaft furnaces of two direct reduction plants of different capacities. The calculated results reveal the detailed interior behavior of the shaft furnace operation. Eight different zones can be distinguished, according to their predominant thermal and reaction characteristics. An important finding is the presence of a central zone of lesser temperature and conversionhttps://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/11/10/1865\n",
    "10. Hematite reduction using hydrogen was conducted and the various process parameters were closely observed. A lab scale fluidized bed unit was designed especially for this study. The optimal values of the gas velocity, reduction time and temperature were evaluated. The values which indicated the highest reduction rate were set as fixed parameters for the following tests starting with the reduction time of 30 minutes and 750 ℃ of temperature. Among these variables the one with the highest interest was the gas specific consumption. It will tell the amount of the gas which is required to achieve a reduction rate of over 90% at the optimal conditions. This parameter is important for the scale up of the lab scale unit. 1,500 Nm3/ton-ore was found to be the optimal specific gas consumption rate at which the reduction rates exhibit the highest values for hematite.https://www.cheric.org/research/tech/periodicals/view.php?seq=1342370\n",
